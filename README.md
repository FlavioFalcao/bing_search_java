=A simple wrapper for the new 2012) Microsoft Bing Web Search API

You will need an auth token from Microsoft. Currently, 100 searches/day are free.

I set the following in my environment:

BING_API_KEY=AQi3....kHAyAQ

Substitute your Microsoft BING API key.

I also use this wrapper library in Clojure
